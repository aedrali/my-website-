    <p> I play competitive club soccer at SF United FC and on Mission High's varsity team. I started playing soccer when I was seven years old and I currently play left back. </p>

    <p> I do yoga to maintain a healthy attitude and energy and to take care of my body during the soccer season. If I'm really angry or stressed about something, I go to yoga and it calms me down. It helps with injury prevention and I always feel better after I go to a class. </p>

        <p> I like to draw, paint, sculpt and making collages. Its relaxing challenging at the same time.</p>
